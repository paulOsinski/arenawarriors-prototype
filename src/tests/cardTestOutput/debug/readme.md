## Card Test Output
This is where the csv output for the card tests is stored.  There is a seperate .csv file at each card level (level1-level10).  These are big files (100MB + and 1 million lines) so I have not included them in the repository.

## /DEBUG
This is where the 'debug' csv files are stored.  I use these to evaluate any inconsistencies in the main dataset.  They can most likely be ignored.
